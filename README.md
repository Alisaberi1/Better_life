# Better_life
Jamshid Kazemi (who is known by the pseudonym Kamran Pouriai), has recently become a man and has been released from prison. He saw the advertisement of the "Better Life for a Better Tomorrow" conference on TV and decided to participate in the conference! After registering and paying an exorbitant amount of money for this conference on the relevant website, he was sent his row number and seat number in the conference.

We know that this conference will be held in Milad Tower conference hall. This hall has 10 rows and each row has 20 seats. Rows are numbered from bottom to top with 1, 2, ... and 10, and seats in each row are numbered from left to right with 1, 2, ... 20.



Now the day of the conference has arrived and Jamshid has come to the conference hall and entered the hall from above. In order to pass through less seats in a row to get to his place, he goes to the right if his seat number is between 1 and 10, and otherwise he goes to the left. Since the hall is dark, he does not see the numbers of rows and seats. Therefore, it is necessary for him to know that his row is the second row from the top, and his seat is the second row from the direction he enters the row. Write a program that says which way to go and how many rows to go down and sit in the how many seats from the direction it enters the row.


# input
r and c as integer number for rows and seats number.
# output
print a and b as rows from up to down and our seats number from up to down.
